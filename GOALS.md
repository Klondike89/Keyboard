# Keyboard Project Ideas

- a GUI is needed
- It should allow the user to program each key
- It should allow for layers
- It should allow for different key press types

- Must output .json file
- .json files should be able to be read so they can be edited

- There should be in app documentation

- Use dictionaries to store key press types
- Use dicts for all keys and codes
